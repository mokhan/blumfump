# Baku

> The Baku is a gigantic sea serpent which inhabits a community of Mer people on an unknown ice planet.
> It inhabits the deep-sea realm under a thick layer of polar ice, surviving by mind-controlling it's prey around it to feed themselves to the "Baku garden": the resting place of the manipulative worm.
> When Hunk and Lance become stranded in the undersea kingdom, they help to rid the populous of control by killing the Baku.
